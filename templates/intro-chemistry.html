            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                Chemistry is a branch of science that deals with the study of matter, its composition,
                structure, properties, and the changes it undergoes during chemical reactions.
                Everything around us is made up of matter, including air, water, food, and even our bodies.

                <p class="mb-0">
                    Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Matter exists in different forms
                    called states of matter. The three common states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.

                    Chemistry plays a vital role in our daily lives. It helps us understand how substances
                    interact, how medicines are made, how food is preserved, and how materials like plastics,
                    glass, and metals are produced.
